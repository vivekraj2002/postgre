## Introduction of PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.

Being an open-source software, its source code is available under PostgreSQL license, a liberal open source license. Anyone with the right skills is free to use, modify, and distribute PostgreSQL in any form. As it is highly stable, very low effort is required to maintain this DBMS.

## What is Database

A database is an organized collection of data, stored and accessed electronically. Databases are used to store and manage large amounts of structured and unstructured data, and they can be used to support a wide range of activities, including data storage, data analysis, and data management.

## Database vs DBMS

**Database:** A database is an organized collection of structured data or information, typically stored electronically in a computer system. It can include tables, queries, reports, views, and other objects that hold and manage data

Example :- Customer data (Name, Address & Contact No.)

</br>

**DBMS (Database Management System):** A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that helps manage and organize data. It lets users create, change, and query a database while also handling security and access controls.

A DBMS makes storing and retrieving data easy and efficient.

Example :- MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle Database. 
</br>

## What is RDBMS

A relational database management system (RDBMS) stores data in tables with rows and columns. It's widely used in industries due to its popularity. Each table has a key field called a primary key, which uniquely identifies each record. This primary key helps in referencing records easily. Examples of RDBMS include Oracle Database, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.

   ## What is CRUD

   CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic operations that can be performed on data in a database or a data store. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of each operation:

   **Firstly we will create a database for creating a  table to perform CRUD operation**

   <div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="./image/database1.png" alt="alt  text" >
   </div> </br>

   ***1. Create :-***

   This operation is used to add new records or data to a database.
   Example: 
   INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)</br> VALUES (value1, value2, ...);

   **Input Query**

   <div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="./image/Craete input.png" alt="alt    text" >
   </div>

   **Output**

   <div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="./image/create output .png" alt="alt text" >
   </div>

   **Create a table & Insert values in table**

   INSERT INTO Raj (id, name, city) </br>
   VALUES </br>
   (101, 'Vivek', 'Noida'), </br>
   (102, 'Aditya', 'Delhi'), </br>
   (103, 'Nitish', 'Haryana');

   **Output**
    
   <div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="./image/Create insert.png" alt="alt text" >
   </div>

   ***2. Read :-***

   This operation is used to Reading data from the database.
   Example: SELECT * FROM <table_name>  </br>

   SELECT * FROM Raj; (* means whole column & Row) </br>
   
   **Output** </br>

   <div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="./image/Read.png" alt="alt text" >
   </div>   </br>

   SELECT name FROM Raj; (mention name column to read only name) </br>
    
   **Output** </br>

   <div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="./image/name read.png" alt="alt text" >
   </div>


   ***3. Update :-***

   This operation is used to modify existing data in the database.
    Example: UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition; 
    </br>
   
   EX- UPDATE Raj  </br>
    SET city='Banglore' </br>
    WHERE  </br>
    name= 'Aditya'; </br>

   **Output** </br>

   <div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="./image/update.png" alt="alt text" >
   </div>   </br>
   
   ***4. Delete :-***

   This operation is used to remove data from the database.
   Example: DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

   EX- Delete FROM Raj </br>
   WHERE id=102; </br>

   **Output** </br>
    
   <div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="./image/Delete.png" alt="alt text" >
   </div>
   </br>

   ## Datatypes 

   An attribute that specifies the type of data in a column of our database-table.

   **Most widely used are**

   NUMERIC - INT, DOUBLE, FLOAT, DECIMAL </br>
   STRING - VARCHAR  </br>
   DATE - DATE     </br>
   BOOLEAN - BOOLEAN   </br>
   
   EXAMPLE - DECIMAL (5,2) </br>

   - 155.38 (it means total 5 digits & after decimal 2 digits)

   
   ## Operators

   - ### Equal To 
   The `=` operator is used when we want to return all records where a column is equal to a specified value:
   ```
   SELECT * FROM employees
   WHERE dept = 'IT';
   ```
   **Output**

   <div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="./image/operator.png" alt="alt text" >
   </div> </br>

   - ### Less Than
   The `<` operator is used when we want to return all records where a column is less than a specified value.
   ```
   SELECT * FROM Employees,
   WHERE Salary < 50000; 
   ```
   ### Other some operators are:
   `=`	Equal to  
   `<`	Less than  
   `>`	Greater than  
   `<=`	Less than or equal to  
   `>=`	Greater than or equal to  
   `!=`	Not equal to  
   `AND`	Logical AND  
   `OR`	Logical OR  
   `IN`	Check if a value is between a range of values  
   `BETWEEN`	Check if a value is between a range of values  
   `IS NULL`	Check if a value is NULL  

   ## Clause

   - Where
   - Distinct
   - Order By
   - Limit
   - Like

   1. **Where**

   The WHERE clause is used in a PostgreSQL statement to filter data based on conditions specified in the WHERE clause. The WHERE clause can be used to filter data based on a single criteria or multiple criteria.

   Ex- 
   ```
   SELECT * FROM employees 
   WHERE dept = 'IT'  
   OR dept = 'HR'     
   OR dept = 'Finance'; 
   ```
   2. **Distinct**

   The DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

   EX-
   ```
   SELECT DISTINCT fname FROM employees;
   ```

   **Order By**

   The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result in ascending or descending order.

   Ex- 
   ```
   SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY fname;
   ```

   **Limit**

   The LIMIT clause is used to limit the maximum number of records to return.

   EX-
   ```
   SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 3;
   ```
   **Like**

   The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

   The two wildcards used with the LIKE operator are:

   - % The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters
   - _ The underscore sign represents one, single character
    
   ***To return records that starts with a specific letter or phrase, add the % at the end of the letter or phrase.***

   EX- 
   ```
   Select * FROM employees
   WHERE fname LIKE 'A%'; 
   ``` 

   ***Return all last name from a lname that starts with 'K' followed by one wildcard character, then 'ar' and then two wildcard characters.
   ***

   EX-
   ```
   Select * FROM employees 
   WHERE lname LIKE 'k__ar';
   ``` 
   
<!--    
   ## JOINS

   JOIN operation is used to combine rows
   from two or more tables based on a related
   column between them.

   <div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="./image/join.png" alt="alt text" >
   </div> </br>


   **Types of JOINS**

   - ***Cross Join :-***  Returns the Cartesian product of both tables. Every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table.

    Example: Combine every employee with every department. 

   - ***Inner Join :-*** Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.

    Example: Show employees and their department names, but only if they have a department. 

   - ***Left Join :-*** Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. If there's no match, the result is NULL from the right side.

    Example: Show all employees and their department names, including employees without a department.

   - ***Right Join :-*** Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table. If there's no match, the result is NULL from the left side.

    Example: Show all departments and their employees, including departments with no employees.  -->

   ## Conclusion
   
   PostgreSQL is a powerful free database known for its flexibility, reliability, and help from a large community. It works well for all kinds of projects, big or small, because it's stable, follows industry standards, and handles complicated jobs easily.
